This repository contains my work when I was a masters student at UNLV. This was a project 
for my time series analysis class where I performed model fitting and spectral analysis for
the AMD and Intel April 2020 to April 2021 stock datasets. I fit several ARIMA models to 
determine the model of best fit. After that, I provide forecasted the ending stock prices
for the next 5 market days. There are accompanying pictures. Afterwards, I compared both
datasets to determine any correlations and periodic behaviors. The periodograms suggested
that there was a lack of seasonal trends.
